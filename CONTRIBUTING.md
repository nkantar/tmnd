# Contributing Guidelines

This project currently isn’t in a place to accept meaningful contributions. [Issues](https://github.com/nkantar/tmnd/issues "Issues · nkantar/tmnd") and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/nkantar/tmnd/pulls "Pull requests · nkantar/tmnd") are open if you _really_ want to take advantage of them, but please keep your expectations low.

It is quite likely that the project will be open to community contributions at some point in the (relatively near?) future, and at such time this guide will be updated.

Thanks!
