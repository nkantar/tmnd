[TheMixNeverDies.com](https://themixneverdies.com "The Mix Never Dies") (TMND) will be a place for the music you “like” on your streaming platform of choice. The first implementation will focus on [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/ "YouTube Music"), as that’s the maintainer’s service of choice. Ideally, support for other services—e.g., [Spotify](https://spotify.com/ "Spotify"), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ "Apple Music"), and [Tidal](https://tidal.com/ "Tidal")—will be added over time, but no promises.

## Features

TMND aims to provide the user with two things:

1. Music streaming services allow the user to “like” songs and then provide a special “liked songs” playlist, but for some reason sharing this playlist is impossible. TMND will create a regular playlist in the user’s account and keep it in sync with the auto-generated one.

2. TMND will provide a blog of embedded songs, complete with an RSS/Atom feed.
